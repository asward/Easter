Dear Children,

Easter Bunny (He/Him) here. I usually have a jovial tone to these things, but this year has been...busy. I don't see any reason why we shouldn't keep up the game, but I'm sick of rhyming. Also, how old are you now? Let's cut the crap. I think it's time we ramp up the difficulty here. This years' riddles are going to be more difficult. I also have some leverage on your parents so they will not be helping.

A few things you'll need to get your rewards:

- Calculator
- Internet connected device with browser. (Chrome v125+ or FireFox 124.0+)
- Compass (or other means to obtain magnetic headings)
- Basic hygiene 
- Tape measure
- Shoes
- Each other

Search for your first clue where I DUNK my eggs into your BASKETS.
